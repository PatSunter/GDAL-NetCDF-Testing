Positives:
 - Got both AEA (Albers Equal Area) and LC (Lambert Conformal) to 
   reproject properly for a Melb test dataset (EPSG:3112 and EPSG:3577)


Key points:

 :CF-1 conventions seem to use consistently different params:
 Lats:
 - 'latitude_of_projection_origin' instead of 'latitude_of_center' (in WKT)
 Lons:
 - 'longitude_of_projection_origin' instead of 'longitude_of_center'
     (In many cases, sometimes WKT also uses proj origin)
 - Also, 'longitude_of_central_meridian' (for AEA) also used instead of 'longitude_of_center' sometimes.
    (Qtn: are the above 2 used in exactly the same meaning?)

So: for longitude_of_center, it seems there is no universal translation when
 exporting to NetCDF: sometimes we need to map to 
 'longitude_of_central_meridian', whereas sometimes 'longitude_of_projection_origin'

This seems to mean going beyond the current oNetcdfSRS lookup table: 
 perhaps with a separate translation table per-projection (IE a 2D 'ragged' array ... can this be defined in the header in C++?)
 - Arguably this is slightly more maintenance, but at least its explicit! 
   And will support clearer debugging/testing of the separate projections.
 - AND: also usable for import/export.  

(Or alternative is special cases just for these problematic variables
... as with standard_parallel stuff)
