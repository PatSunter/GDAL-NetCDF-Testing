In PDS's patched code:
----------------------

In ogr/ogr_srs_esri.cpp

Line 1221: before remap
 *GetAttrNode( "PROJCS" )->papoChildNodes[4]->papoChildNodes[0]
$33 = {pszValue = 0x80719e8 "central_meridian", papoChildNodes = 0x0, 
  poParent = 0x80719a8, nChildren = 0} 

Line 1223: after remap:
$34 = {pszValue = 0x80719e8 "Longitude_Of_Center", papoChildNodes = 0x0, 
  poParent = 0x80719a8, nChildren = 0}


In old code:
------------

Remapping seems to occur in RemapPNamesBasedOnProjCSAndPName()

based on a 'mappingTable' input var.

Ah - in ogr_srs_esri_names.h, there is an ogr_srs_esri_names mapping table,
apszParamNameMapping[] (line 207), that contains:
"Orthographic", "central_meridian", "Longitude_Of_Center",
"Orthographic", "latitude_of_origin", "Latitude_Of_Center",

So why isn't this used in import also??

Summary notes on this approach:
-------------------------------

(In case useful for NetCDF driver)

 1) Copy all parameters across from OGC WKT
 2) Loop through, and for particular projections that involve any advanced
    refactorings, (eg LCC), apply these
 3) As a final check:
    * Apply a standard set of remappings of attrib names
    * Apply a standard set of remappings of values (eg roundings etc)

Hmmm ... it does work and cut down amount of code - but has some potentially
 dodgy aspects as well it seems (e.g. for reversing, seems they forgot to
 apply these remappings)
